In order to compile the "OneArmPhaseTwoStudy_GUI" you will need to follow the 
steps given below:

1. Install R on your operating system following the instructions given on 
   "https://cran.r-project.org/".
   1.1 After installation run R and install the packages "RInside" and
       "OneArmPhaseTwoStudy" by issuing the commands:
       - install.packages("RInside")
       - install.packages("oneArmPhaseTwoStudy")

2. Install Qt version 4.8.x on your operating system following the instructions 
   given on "https://www.qt.io/".
   	- It is important that the libraries provided by Qt are build with the 
   	  same compiler which were used to compile R. This ensures that 
   	  libraries from R and Qt can be linked together.  
   	  
3. After installation of these requirements you should be able to switch to the 
   "source"-folder, open a terminal and issue the following commands:
   	- qmake "OneArmPhaseTwoStudy_GUI.pro"
   	- make
   	
After execution of "make" you should obtain an executable named 
"OneArmPhaseTwoStudy_GUI" which implements the GUI for the "OneArmPhaseTwoStudy"
R-package.
